# In discussion

- Add handsaw double damage interaction.

- Make the charges indicator directional.

- Make so that the adrenaline effect expires after 10 seconds.

- Add a delay (to create suspense) before showing the outcome of the expired medicine.

- Make items that cannot be used right now greyed out.

- Turn up the multimedia volume of the phone when a player takes damage.

- Make so that when the shotgun is empty it's instantly reloaded when in dealerless mode, eliminating the need for a dedicated reload button.

- Add fullscreen item showcase and description on press and directly use an item on long press.

# Planned

- Make so that when handcuffs are used, you can't cuff dead players.

- Make so that you can't use handcuffs when all alive players are already cuffed (now it only works when all the players are alive).

- Block the use of items in dead player inventories (exept when adrenaline is used).

- Block the use of items when the shell sequence is empty.

- Add more haptic feedback on more buttons.

- Refactoring of adrenaline logic.

- Redesign Dealer page

- Retake app screenshots after the redesign
