- Add a delay (to create suspense) before showing the outcome of the expired medicine.

- Make items that cannot be used right now greyed out.

- Turn up the multimedia volume of the phone when a player takes damage.

- Make so that when the shotgun is empty it's instantly reloaded when in dealerless mode, eliminating the need for a dedicated reload button.
