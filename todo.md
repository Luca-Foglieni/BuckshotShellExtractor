# In discussion

- Add handsaw double damage interaction

- Make the charges indicator directional

- Make so that the adrenaline effect expires after 10 seconds

- Add a delay (to create suspense) before showing the outcome of the expired medicine

- Make items that cannot be used right now greyed out

- Turn up the multimedia volume of the phone when a player takes damage

# Planned

- Refactoring of manual and automatic items modes to unify them.

- Add a way to play without the Dealer.

- Make so that reload and eject buttons are contestual and not always present even when they can't be used.

- Add more haptic feedback on more buttons.

- Add a new main page to better select the gamemode.

- Refactoring of adrenaline logic.
