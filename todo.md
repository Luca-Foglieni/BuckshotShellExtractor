# In discussion

- Add handsaw double damage interaction.

- Make the charges indicator directional.

- Make so that the adrenaline effect expires after 10 seconds.

- Add a delay (to create suspense) before showing the outcome of the expired medicine.

- Make items that cannot be used right now greyed out.

- Turn up the multimedia volume of the phone when a player takes damage.

- Make so that when the shotgun is empty it's instantly reloaded when in dealerless mode, eliminating the need for a dedicated reload button.

# Planned

- Refactoring of manual, automatic and dealerless items modes to unify them.

- Add more haptic feedback on more buttons.

- Refactoring of adrenaline logic.

- Make it more clear when the shown shell is shot or not to avoid confusion.
