# In discussion

- Add handsaw double damage interaction

- Make the charges indicator directional

- Make so that the adrenaline effect expires after 10 seconds

- Add a delay (to create suspense) before showing the outcome of the expired medicine

- Make items that cannot be momentarily used greyed out

# Planned

1. Add a second intermediate state to signify that a player has already skipped a turn due to the handcuffs but cannot yet be handcuffed again before playing a round

3. Add a second items table mode that exclusively works manually, so that more than one phone can be used to simulate the items
